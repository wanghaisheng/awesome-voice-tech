From "[Voice Tech Landscape: 150+ Infrastructure, Horizontal and Vertical Startups Mapped and Analysed](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/voice-tech-landscape-150-startups-mapped-and-analysed-82c5adaf710)", Savina van der Straten, Dec 13, 2017.

In healthcare, voice technology finds a market particularly rife with potential and impactful use cases. The high cost of labor for physicians and other skilled workers - who spent countless hours inputting data into their electronic health records - is one example of an opportunity for startups to disrupt the status quo. In fact, [one landscape of B2B voice technology startups](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/voice-tech-landscape-150-startups-mapped-and-analysed-82c5adaf710) across all verticals found that 47.1% of companies that were focused on a single sector were focused on healthcare. We sorted 36 startups building products at the intersection of voice and healthcare by how they are tackling this market, in hopes of giving those interested in learning more about this exciting frontier an opportunity to check out what voice-based innovations might hit their office, clinic, or home in the next several years.

Aging in Place
--------------

Voice is uniquely positioned to be a valuable tool for seniors who wish to stay in their homes - especially for those who are unable to use other forms of technology that may require mobility, dexterity of the hands, and/or good vision (such as smartphones). These startups take advantage of voice-first technology for seniors.

Patient-Provider Communication
------------------------------

Physician Notes
---------------

42% of physicians feel “burned out,” [according to Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2018-lifestyle-burnout-depression-6009235#2). One of the major causes is the amount of time clinicians inevitably spend behind a computer, entering information from their last patient interaction into their electronic health record (EHR). Several startups are using voice technology as a virtual scribe to enter physician notes into the EHR.

Speech & Hearing Difficulty

*   [ConversationHealth](http://www.conversationhealth.com/) creates powerful bots to support the clinical journey of all stakeholders.
*   [Orbita](https://orbita.ai/) is an enterprise-grade platform for creating And maintaining voice-powered healthcare applications, across both voice and chatbot interfaces.

Patient Engagement
------------------

These startups take their voice applications to the patient's home, and use a voice interface to keep patients engaged in their care in between visits with their providers. Many are designed for patients with chronic conditions, to help close gaps in care for the 99% of time that a patient is not in their doctor's office.
